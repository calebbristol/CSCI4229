This homework took me approximately 6 hours to finish. 

A large portion of time was spent getting the skybox right (I downloaded some bad textures at first). The
resolution for the skybox was higher than the suggested max texture size, but I thought it was fitting since
it takes up the entire screen all the time. A lot of time was also spent in gimp, adjusting my textures to 
suit the project.
