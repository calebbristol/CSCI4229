5) This took about 5/6 hours to finish, not because I did anything exceptional, but most of the time was spent
trying to figure out OpenGL without plainly copying and pasting code from the examples. There was about an hour
or so time spent actually getting the lorenz attractor working. 

5a) On the note of not plainly copying and pasting code, a lot of the code was taken from ex7. Most of the
logistical elements (Print, Fatal, ErrCheck, Axis Display, reshape, view changing, and main) were for the most
part taken from the example, though modified to accomodate this project. The brunt of original code was written
in the Lorenz function, as well as the display function.
