CSCI 4229 Homework 3: 3D Scene
Author: Caleb Bristol
Credit to teaching team for large portion of foundational code:
including sphere construction code 
and basis for shapes / scene

///////////////////////////////
Inputs:
-Arrow Keys: Rotate Scene
-Esc: Exit Scene
-0: Reset View


///////////////////////////////
Key functions provided by me are the "outline" functions that outline the basic constructs, the cubamid (or 
trapezoidal pyramid, I don't really know what the shape is called), and the spaceship function.

The scene draws a "planet" (I just used the provided sphere code from the examples) and puts a fleet of spaceships
orbiting around it. The ships don't move to user input (yet) and the scene isn't very interactable (also yet) 
because I spent way too much time designing a spaceship and making it look pretty.

About 6-7 hours were spent on this assignment, though it doesn't show entirely in the code. I did additionally
take the time to draft and dimension the spaceship out so constructing it would be easier. I didn't include any
of it because this isn't an art class, and getting files from my ipad to my pc makes my head hurt, so just look
at the pretty 3d model I guess.

Side Note: On my last submission, a comment stated that my executable was named incorrectly. I am new to makefiles
and it was hw# on my computer, so please let me know if it still doesn't show up as such on your computer. ty (^_^)
