The project took about 3 hours to complete. The code for perspective overhead was taken from example 9, so the
large extent of my work was the first person implementation. It was a lot of tweaking to make sure that it worked
exactly how I wanted it. A lot of smaller things such as what happens when you keep looking up, or getting 
directional controls working. I am still not quite happy with the result, as my intention for my game (when time 
for the project comes around) would be to have a third person perspective looking over a ship, with controls 
being slowing down/ speeding up or changing the roll/pitch/yaw to navigate. As far as this homework goes though,
I think the implementation was sufficient. It allows movement in all three axes, and correctly displayed for the 
amount of time I moved around the scene.

First Person navigation was a lot easier once I just drew some axes on paper so goes to show that computers can't
solve all of our problems.
